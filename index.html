    <p>## Myanmar Devastated by Earthquake: Thousands Dead, Infrastructure Crumbles</p><p><strong>Myanmar</strong> - A catastrophic 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday, leaving over 1,600 dead and thousands injured. Disaster experts fear the toll could rise further. The quake, originating near Mandalay, triggered a red alert from the USGS, warning of potential fatalities ranging from 10,000 to 100,000.</p><p>The shallow depth of the earthquake intensified the shaking in densely populated areas, causing buildings to collapse rapidly. The quake occurred along the Sagaing Fault, where the Indian and Sunda tectonic plates meet, allowing the rupture to spread across a vast area. A 6.7 magnitude aftershock followed, exacerbating the devastation.</p><p>Myanmar's infrastructure and construction practices are under scrutiny. While the nation has seen a surge in high-rise buildings, many lack earthquake-resistant designs. The impact extended to Thailand, where a building under construction in Bangkok collapsed, trapping workers. Experts cited poor construction techniques and Bangkok's soft soil as contributing factors.</p><p>Poor enforcement of building codes and planning regulations in Myanmar worsened the disaster. Ongoing civil war and a collapsing healthcare system are severely hampering relief efforts. As Myanmar grapples with this tragedy, the focus is on search and rescue operations, stricter building codes, and improved disaster preparedness.</p>

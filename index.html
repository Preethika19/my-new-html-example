    <p><strong>South Korea Battles Unprecedented Wildfires; Death Toll Rises to at Least 24</strong></p><p>Seoul, South Korea – South Korea is grappling with its deadliest wildfire outbreak in history, leaving at least 24 people dead and dozens injured.  The fires, which began Friday in the southeastern region of Uiseong County, have spread rapidly due to unusually strong winds (nearly 27 meters per second) and exceptionally dry conditions.  Over 17,000 hectares of forest have been consumed, making this the third-largest wildfire in the country's history by area, but the deadliest by far.</p><p>The acting president, Han Duksoo, declared a national crisis, describing the situation as "unprecedented."  The rapid spread of the flames has forced the evacuation of approximately 23,000 people, who are currently seeking shelter in schools and local gyms.  Dozens of homes and several historic buildings, including a 1300-year-old temple, have been destroyed.  At least one fatality is confirmed to be a helicopter pilot who crashed during firefighting operations, highlighting the perilous conditions faced by emergency responders.</p><p>The government has mobilized a massive response, deploying over 5,000 personnel – including firefighters, soldiers, police, and public officials – and more than 128 helicopters, some provided by the US military stationed in South Korea.  Despite these efforts, the persistent strong winds continue to hamper firefighting operations.</p><p>While wildfires are not uncommon in South Korea during dry spring months, the scale and intensity of this outbreak are unprecedented.  Andrew Salman, Asia correspondent for The Washington Times, noted the unusual weather conditions, describing dust devils and mini-sandstorms caused by the dry ground and high winds – phenomena he has not witnessed in his 25 years living in the country.</p><p>Authorities suspect that some fires may have originated from illegal burning of waste, a common practice in rural areas, particularly among the older generation.  While the government is currently focused on crisis control, discussions about stricter regulations on waste burning and improved emergency response systems are expected to follow.  The government is also promising to investigate the causes of the fires and implement measures to prevent future disasters of this magnitude.  The scale of the devastation and the high death toll have shocked the nation, prompting a national reflection on preparedness and preventative measures.</p>

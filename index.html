    <p><strong>Devastating Earthquake Rocks Myanmar, Death Toll Exceeds 1,000</strong></p><p><strong>Myanmar</strong> - A catastrophic earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday, leaving over 1,000 dead and thousands injured. Experts fear the toll could rise significantly. The 7.7 magnitude quake, centered northwest of Sagarin and just 30 kilometers from Mandalay, triggered a red alert from the USGS, warning of potential fatalities ranging from 10,000 to 100,000.</p><p>The quake's shallow depth intensified the shaking in densely populated areas, causing buildings to collapse rapidly. Originating along the Sagaing Fault, a 1,200-kilometer fault line where the Indian and Sunda tectonic plates meet, the earthquake's impact was widespread. A 6.7 magnitude aftershock followed, raising concerns about further devastation.</p><p>Weak infrastructure and construction practices exacerbated the disaster. While Myanmar has seen a surge in high-rise buildings, many lack earthquake-resistant designs. The tremors were felt as far as Thailand, where a building under construction in Bangkok collapsed. Experts cited poor construction techniques and Bangkok's soft soil as contributing factors.</p><p>The ongoing civil war and a collapsing healthcare system are hampering relief efforts. Focus is now on search and rescue operations, stricter building codes, and improved disaster preparedness.</p>

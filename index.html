    <p><strong>Myanmar Earthquake Claims Over 1,000 Lives, Toll Expected to Rise</strong></p><p><strong>Myanmar</strong> - A catastrophic 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday, leaving over 1,000 dead and thousands injured. Disaster experts fear this could be the strongest quake in decades, with the USGS issuing a red alert, warning fatalities could range from 10,000 to 100,000.</p><p>The quake's shallow depth, originating just 30 kilometers from Mandalay, amplified its impact, causing buildings to crumble rapidly. The earthquake occurred along the Sanghain Fault, where the Indian and Sunda tectonic plates meet. A 6.7 magnitude aftershock followed, raising concerns about further devastation.</p><p>Weak infrastructure and construction practices in Myanmar exacerbated the disaster. While the nation has seen a high-rise building boom, many lack earthquake-resistant designs. The impact extended to Thailand, where a building collapsed in Bangkok, trapping workers. Experts cited poor construction techniques and Bangkok's soft soil as contributing factors.</p><p>Poor enforcement of building codes and planning regulations in Myanmar further magnified the disaster. Ongoing civil war and a collapsing healthcare system are severely hampering relief efforts. Search and rescue operations are underway, with a focus on stricter building codes and improved disaster preparedness.</p>
